## Handling Referred Participants

If a participant was referred by another user:
- You'll see a **purple "Referred" badge** on their profile
- The referral status shows as "Pending KYC"
- When you verify them:
  - They get their 25 GG bonus
  - The referrer automatically gets their tier-based reward
  - Your venue gets 25 GG

## Troubleshooting

### "User already verified"
The participant was already verified at another venue. No action needed.

### Can't find the participant
- Ask them to confirm their registered email
- Check spelling
- They may need to create an account first at **app.gambino.gold**

### ID doesn't match account name
- Ask participant to update their profile first
- Do NOT verify if names don't match

### Participant is under 18
- **Do NOT verify** - politely explain they must be 18+ to participate

### System error during verification
- Note the error message
- Contact Gambino support
- Do not attempt to verify multiple times

## Important Reminders

1. **Never verify without physically seeing the ID** - No phone photos, no "I forgot it"
2. **One verification per participant** - If already verified, system will reject
3. **Document type matters** - Select the correct ID type for records
4. **Your venue is recorded** - All verifications are logged with venue and staff info
5. **Rewards are automatic** - Don't manually add tokens; the system handles it
